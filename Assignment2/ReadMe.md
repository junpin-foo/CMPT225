Part 1 [60 points] - class CircularLinkedList<T>
In this part you need to implement a circular linked list. This is a generic class representing a
doubly linked list of objects arranged on a circle . In contrast to the usually linked list, it does not
have head or tail. Instead the data structure has a pointer to one of the nodes in the list, and
operations allowing to (i) get/set the value of the node under the pointer (iii) move pointer forward
and backward (iii) add a new element before or after the pointer, (iv) remove the node under the
pointer, and more. Specifically, you need to implement the following constructors and operations
  
public CircularLinkedList()
creates an empty circular linked list
  
public CircularLinkedList( int initSize, T initValue)
creates a circular linked list with initial initSize elements, all with the value initValue .
  
public void moveForward(): Moves the pointer one node forward.
If the list has one node, it has no effect.
If the list is empty, throws java.util.NoSuchElementException
  
public void moveBackward(): Moves the pointer one node backward.
If the list has one node, it has no effect.
If the list is empty, throws java.util.NoSuchElementException.
  
public T getValue(): Returns the value in the node under the pointer.
If the list is empty, throws java.util.NoSuchElementException.
  
public T setValue(T value): Sets the value under the pointer.
Returns the previous value in the node under the pointer.
If the list is empty, throws java.util.NoSuchElementException.
  
public void addBefore(T value): Adds a node with the given value before the pointer.
If the list was empty, the pointer is set to point to the new element.
  
public void addAfter(T value): Adds a node with the given value after the pointer.
If the list was empty, the pointer is set to point to the new element.
  
public T removeBefore(): Removes the node right before the pointer.
Returns the element previously in the removed node.
If the list is empty, throws java.util.NoSuchElementException.
  
public T removeAfter(): Removes the node right after the pointer.
Returns the element previously in the removed node.
If the list is empty, throws java.util.NoSuchElementException.
  
public boolean isEmpty(): Checks if the list is empty.
  
  Part 2 [45 points] - class MyStackMoreOperations<T>
In this part you are given a file mystack.jar that contains inside a class mystack.MyStack.
(Really, .jar is just a zip file with the class and some additional meta information).
For your convenience, the assignment also contains the implementation MyStack.java.
You can either add the java file to the project or the provided .jar.
  
The class MyStack<T> implements the standard stack operations: push(), pop(), isEmpty().
However, you donâ€™t get to see the implementation of MyStack, and can access it only using its
public methods.
  
Your goal is to import the jar file into your project (or use the MyStack.java), and implement the
class MyStackMoreOperations. The class has several public static methods manipulating MyStack.
The public methods are the following.
  
public static int size(MyStack<T> s): returns the number of elements in s.
  
public static <T> MyStack<T> clone(MyStack<T> orig): Makes a copy of orig.
  
public static void reverse(MyStack<T> s): Reverses the order of the elements in s.
  
Part 3 [15 points] - class LinkedListNode<T>
In this part you are given a class representing a node in a one directional linked list. The node has
two data fields: data and next. You goal is to write the following method:
public int countReachableNodes(): returns the number of nodes reachable from this .
For example in the structures below we have:
- the number of nodes reachable from X is 4 (X,Y,Z,W)
- the number reachable from W is 1 (only W)
- The number of nodes reachable from A is 5 (A,B,C,D,E)
- The number of nodes reachable from E is 4 (E,B,C,D)
